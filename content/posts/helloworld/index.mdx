First and foremost **_welcome to my blog_**. I am starting this endeavour as a means
of documenting the fantastic technology I am fortunate enough to tinker with
and to share that said knowledge. I hope you will join me on my journey, or
drop in once in a while to have a gander.

Who am I? My name is Carlos Hernandez aka HurricaneHrndz. I have been working
with technology and computers since the age of twelve and professionally since
the age of nineteen. What's more, I have loved every step of the way and would
not trade my career for anything in the world.

My long tenure within this industry has shaped my views and beliefs on
technology. Technology can at times be divisive, so let's get my guiding
principals right in the open.

**One**, I believe in the right tool for the job and will reserve the right to
change my mind as time goes by. Reasoning: because _this field changes all too
often and what was right yesterday might not be right today or tomorrow_.

**Two**, I prefer using **Open Source over proprietary solutions**. I could list
countless reasons based on technological merits alone, although they matter,
I prefer it because _it fulfills my need to be a part of something bigger than
myself_. It feeds a primal longing that I genuinely believe resides within every
one of us. I am one fork and pull away from the chance of being part of human
history, even if it is just as a footnote, I will take it! However, no matter
my drive, rule one supersedes all.

**Three**, have fun! I can not emphasize this enough. Today's technology was built
upon the shoulders of giants that were brave enough to experiment and play. So,
do not be afraid to try something new and challenge the status quo.

**_Let the fun begin!_**
