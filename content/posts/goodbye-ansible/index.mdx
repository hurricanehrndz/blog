Today I formally part ways with Ansible. Well, not really. Ansible is so
pervasive within the configuration management space that there is no avoiding
it. So, I will be seeing you (Ansible) professionally only. For my own personal
configuration management needs, I am embracing Nix.

Yes, I have been taking [Nix pills][nix-pills], and if you are thinking that it
has affected my decision making, you are not wrong. One of those very said Pills
states, _"in the Nix world all existing self-containment and orchestration tools
are deprecated"_, who could walk away unaffected? After all, that is one bold
statement, and I will be putting it to the test in the next couple of weeks.

First impressions lead me to believe they are putting their money where their
mouth is! For example, below is a simple configuration to install a clean OS,
create a user, set the user's default editor to VIM.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

let
  hostName = "HAL9000";
in {
  imports = [
    # Include the results of the hardware scan.
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
  ];

  # Set localization and tty options
  i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";
  console = {
    font = "Lat2-Terminus16";
    keyMap = "us";
  };

  # Set the timezone
  time.timeZone = "America/Edmonton";

  networking = {
    inherit hostName;
    networkmanager.enable = true;
  };

  programs.zsh.enable = true;
  programs.vim.defaultEditor = true;

  users = {
    # Shell is set to zsh for all users as default.
    defaultUserShell = pkgs.zsh;

    users.hurricanehrndz = {
      isNormalUser = true;
      home = "/home/hurricanehrndz";
      description = "Carlos Benito Hernandez";
      extraGroups = [ "wheel" "networkmanager" "audio" ];
      shell = pkgs.zsh;

      # Public ssh-keys that are authorized for the user. Fetched from homepage
      # and github profile.
      openssh.authorizedKeys.keyFiles = [
        (builtins.fetchurl { url = "https://github.com/hurricanehrndz.keys"; })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The Nix language's declarative nature makes the above configuration very
legible, even for those unfamiliar with it. The sheer fact that so much can be
accomplished with a mere 48 lines of code is beautiful and so captivating. In
contrast, achieving a similar outcome with Ansible becomes an ordeal.

One could try to find a role within the Ansible-Galaxy store that accomplishes
something similar. More than likely, you will be left to your own devices. You
will either write a Playbook, develop a custom role, or perhaps write your own
module. The latter will not help Ansible evolve but rather increase complexity
and the uncontrollable growth of Ansible itself.

This [unmanageable expansion][ansible-restructure] can already be witnessed as
modules that use to be considered a core part of Ansible have been increasingly
migrated to community repositories. In contrast, the simplicity in Nix offers a
reprieve.

I can only surmise this simplicity is born from its functional design. Nix is
a functional language at heart, so complexity is created from the composition of
simple functions rather than the never-ending extension of the software. So, as
[Brain Beckman][brain-youtube] said, it seems _"the way to control complexity is
from compositionality"_.

Stay tuned, as I go deeper into Nix and NixOS in the upcoming weeks.
